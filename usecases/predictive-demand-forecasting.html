<h1>Predictive Demand Forecasting & Production Planning</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
Consumer goods manufacturers operate in volatile demand cycles influenced by seasonality, promotion velocity, retailer behavior, macro trends, and social sentiment. Traditional forecasting is slow, backward-looking, and often disconnected from real consumption signals—leading to cascading impacts on cost, capacity, and working capital.
</p>

<h3>Problem It Solves</h3>
<p>
Overproduction drives excess inventory, spoilage, warehousing costs, and write-downs. Underproduction causes out-of-stock events, retailer penalties, lost shelf space, and declining market share.
</p>

<h3>How AI + Automation Changes the Outcome</h3>
<p>
AI continuously ingests POS data, seasonality patterns, weather, macro indicators, and promotional calendars to produce real-time short, mid, and long-term forecasts. Automation converts insights into action—adjusting production schedules, raw material purchasing, and capacity allocation automatically.
</p>

<h3>What Customers Can Expect</h3>
<p>
More confident planning, improved forecast accuracy, and fewer firefighting escalations between sales, supply chain, finance, and plant operations.
</p>

<h3>Value</h3>
<ul>
  <li>5–15% reduction in total inventory held</li>
  <li>20–40% reduction in stockout-related penalties</li>
  <li>3–6% improvement in gross margin</li>
  <li>Frees planners from manual spreadsheet consolidation</li>
</ul>
