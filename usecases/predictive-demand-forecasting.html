  <h1>Predictive Demand Forecasting & Production Planning</h1>

  <p>
    Consumer goods manufacturers operate in volatile demand cycles influenced by
    seasonality, promotion velocity, retail replenishment, macro trends, and shifting
    consumer sentiment. Traditional forecasting methods are backward-looking,
    spreadsheet-driven, and disconnected from actual consumption signals — creating
    cost, capacity, and service level risk.
  </p>

  <h2>Problem It Solves</h2>
  <p>
    Overproduction drives excess inventory, warehousing expense, spoilage, and
    product write-downs. Underproduction results in out-of-stocks, lost shelf
    positioning, retailer penalties, and market share erosion.
  </p>

  <h2>How AI + Automation Changes the Outcome</h2>
  <p>
    AI models continuously ingest POS data, weather, search trends, marketing calendars,
    macro indicators, and retailer sell-through to produce real-time forecasts. Workflow
    automation triggers raw material ordering, production schedule shifts, inventory
    rebalancing, and distribution changes — not just reporting.
  </p>

  <h2>What Customers Can Expect</h2>
  <p>
    Higher planning confidence, cross-functional alignment, and fewer urgent
    rescheduling escalations between sales, supply chain, and plant operations.
  </p>

  <h2>Value</h2>
