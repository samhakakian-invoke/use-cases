<h1>Intelligent Production Scheduling Optimization</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
Production scheduling in consumer goods manufacturing is complex—planners must balance changeovers, setup time, batch sequencing, allergen controls, packaging availability, sanitation timing, and capacity restrictions. Most rely on spreadsheets, static rules, or intuition.
</p>

<h3>Problem It Solves</h3>
<p>
Planners spend hours building “good enough” schedules. The result—lower throughput, higher operating cost, and constant firefighting.
</p>

<h3>How AI + Automation Changes the Outcome</h3>
<p>
AI performs multi-variable optimization across constraints in real time. Automation pushes the optimal schedule into MES, triggers machine prep workflows, allocates labor, and notifies operators—eliminating manual coordination effort.
</p>

<h3>What Customers Can Expect</h3>
<p>
Higher throughput, fewer schedule breaks, smoother changeovers, and reduced cognitive burden on planners.
</p>

<h3>Value</h3>
<ul>
  <li>4–10% increase in line throughput</li>
  <li>8–20% reduction in changeover time and cost</li>
  <li>10–25% reduction in schedule volatility</li>
</ul>
