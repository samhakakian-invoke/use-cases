  <h1>Intelligent Production Scheduling Optimization</h1>

  <p>
    Production scheduling in consumer goods manufacturing is a high-constraint
    optimization challenge. Planners must account for changeovers, sanitation,
    allergen risk, crew availability, packaging readiness, equipment capacity,
    maintenance windows, and fulfillment commitments — often using spreadsheets
    and tribal knowledge.
  </p>

  <h2>Problem It Solves</h2>
  <p>
    Manual scheduling produces avoidable downtime, higher setup cost, inefficient
    batching, and constant firefighting driven by reactive adjustments.
  </p>

  <h2>How AI + Automation Changes the Outcome</h2>
  <p>
    AI evaluates thousands of production sequences in real-time across operational
    constraints — generating the mathematically optimal schedule. Automation pushes
    the schedule into MES, triggers prep workflows, notifies teams, and reallocates
    labor — without manual coordination.
  </p>

  <h2>What Customers Can Expect</h2>
  <p>
    Faster schedule creation, fewer breaks, smoother changeovers, and increased
    plant throughput.
  </p>

  <h2>Value</h2>
  <ul class="value-list">
    <li>4–10% increase in sustained line throughput</li>
    <li>8–20% reduction in changeover time and cost</li>
    <li>10–25% reduction in schedule volatility</li>
  </ul>
