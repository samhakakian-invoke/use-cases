  <h1>Predictive Maintenance for Packaging & Line Equipment</h1>

  <p>
    Most consumer goods throughput losses originate from unplanned failures across
    filling, capping, sealing, labeling, wrapping, and packaging equipment. Traditional
    maintenance schedules are reactive or based on fixed intervals — not real asset
    health.
  </p>

  <h2>Problem It Solves</h2>
  <p>
    When a critical line component goes down, throughput collapses, orders back up,
    labor sits idle, and recovery costs compound.
  </p>

  <h2>How AI + Automation Changes the Outcome</h2>
  <p>
    AI analyzes vibration, thermal data, telemetry, bearing noise, pressure readings,
    and electrical signatures to detect degradation patterns before failure occurs.
    Automation creates work orders, schedules technicians, sources spare parts, and
    adjusts production sequencing automatically.
  </p>

  <h2>What Customers Can Expect</h2>
  <p>
    Higher OEE, predictable uptime, and more reliable packaging operations.
  </p>

  <h2>Value</h2>
  <ul class="value-list">
    <li>20–50% reduction in unplanned downtime</li>
    <li>5–12% OEE improvement</li>
    <li>2–5 year extension of asset lifespan</li>
  </ul>
